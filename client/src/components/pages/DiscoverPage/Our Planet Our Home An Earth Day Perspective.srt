1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,090
THE THIRD ROCK.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,940
THE BLUE MARBLE.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,370
EARTH.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,800
HOME.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,720
EVERY PERSON, PLACE OR THING WE KNOW … EVERYTHING
WE DO.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,040
EVERY MEMORY WE MAKE.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,200
IT’S HERE.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,770
ON THIS PALE BLUE DOT.

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:25,730
IT’S JUST ONE ROCKY PLANET IN ONE SOLAR
SYSTEM IN ONE GALAXY AMONG BILLIONS. 

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,960
EVEN AS WE EXPLORE SPACE, WE STUDY OUR HOME
PLANET.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,099
WE SEE IT LIKE NO ONE ELSE.

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,649
AN EXPANSIVE ECOSYSTEM-- THE VEGETATION, THE
AIR, THE WATER, THE ICE. 

13
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:49,879
OUR DATA IMPROVES THE WAY WE GROW FOOD AND
HOW WE MANAGE THE LAND WE CULTIVATE.

14
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,799
NASA HAS OVER 20 SATELLITES MEASURING THE
HEIGHT OF OCEANS AND INLAND WATERS, CLOUDS

15
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,780
AND PRECIPITATION, CARBON DIOXIDE AND MUCH
MORE.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,150
FOR DECADES, OUR DATA HAS TRACKED HOW ALL
THESE EARTH SYSTEMS INTERACT.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,410
FROM ABOVE, WE SEE THE CONNECTIONS. 

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,330
CITIES TRANSITION INTO FARM LANDS.

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,940
TRIBUTARIES FLOW INTO RIVERS INTO the Sea.

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,930
WINDS MOVE CLOUDS AROUND THE PLANET. 

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,630
BEYOND THESE OBSERVATIONS, NASA’S ABILITY
TO MODEL AND ANTICIPATE HOW THE PLANET IS

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,610
CHANGING HELPS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD
PREPARE.

23
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:36,160
WE SEE OUR CHANGING PLANET – HURRICANES,
VOLCANOS, FIRES…

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,600
AND WE SEE THE IMPACTS OF HUMANS --- MELTING
ICE, RISING TEMPERATURES. 

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,270
EARTH’S CLIMATE HAS CHANGED AND IS STILL
CHANGING.  

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,950
OUR DATA GIVES US THE UNDERSTANDING TO ADAPT
--  AND TO PROTECT OUR HOME PLANET IN NEW

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,220
WAYS.

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,780
OUR ELECTRIC FLIGHT TECHNOLOGIES WILL REDUCE
FUEL AND SAVE ENERGY.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,170
WE WILL MAKE CLEANER AIR TRAVEL POSSIBLE.

30
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:11,009
BY UNDERSTANDING OUR CHANGING WORLD, WE IMPROVE
LIVES AND SAFEGUARD OUR FUTURE.

31
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,680
THE FUTURE OF OUR LITTLE ROCK IN THE UNIVERSE.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,099
OUR EARTH.

33
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:31,280
OUR HOME.
